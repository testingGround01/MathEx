# MathEx

MathEx is a single-page math practice tool that helps you drill skills like addition, multiplication, fractions, roots and more. It stores your progress in the browser and shows detailed statistics after each session.

## Features
- Choose practice types and difficulty levels
- Fixed-question or timed modes
- Tracks accuracy and speed
- Results visualized with bar and pie charts
- Stores session history in local storage
- Dark and light theme toggle

## Getting Started
Just open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step is required.

## Development
The project now separates styles and scripts:

- `main.css` – styles used across the app
- `app.js` – all JavaScript functionality

Feel free to modify these files and open `index.html` to see changes. A network connection is required only for loading Google Fonts.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages
This site is completely static. To publish it on GitHub Pages, enable Pages in your repository settings and select the main branch.
All files live in the repository root so no build step is needed.
